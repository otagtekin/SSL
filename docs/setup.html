<span style="color: #cc4b00;font-weight: bold;">Let's setup our environment!</span><br><br>
<p>
We are going to use Linux Ubuntu for this class. Your Mac already has terminal, it's always a good idea to practice workspaces that are designed for hosted code. Since it is not a good idea to use personal device to host a website, we will use a virtual machine with a virtual operating system to make things more realistic.
</p>
<p>Things we need:
	<ul>
		<li>Terminal window</li>
		<li>Code editor (I will use Sublime)</li>
		<li>Virtual Box</li>
		<li>Vagrant</li>
	</ul>
</p>

Vagrant

<br><br>
<b>Note:</b><br>
Before you run Vagrant Up, you must enable the certain plugins. Open up your terminal and enter the following command before going through the next steps.

<br><br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;vagrant plugin install vagrant-triggers</b>

<br><br>If your vagrant add box ubuntu/trusty64 is giving you " not found  error" execute the following command and try again.
<br><br>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo rm /opt/vagrant/embedded/bin/curl</b>



<br><br>Virtualbox

<br><br>Now let's add our operating system to our virtual machine

<span style="color: #cc4b00;font-weight: bold;">Next</span><br><br>
<p>Now we are ready to work on our code. You will see that some of the programming langurages we need for this class are already waiting for us. These languages are native to the operating systems and they already have running proccesses. We will also use these languages to execute simple scripts. You can count this as your introduction to DevOps world.</p>

The Server-Side Languages course examines the benefits of a server-side scripting language to heighten human-computer interaction with web content. In this course, students will learn how to take their existing knowledge of static-based web content and implement a server-side scripting language to develop a more robust web application. By implementing server-side languages within standards-compliant HTML web pages, students will be able to deploy dynamic content to further the level of interaction between client and server communication.

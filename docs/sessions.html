<br> Session are really important for Web Applications. That's how we authenticatte users and also keep track of the authentication status.
<br> Sessions are server-side and cookies are client. Users can not access sessions that's what makes them secure. Cookies on the other hand, are accessable via browser. Take a look at your console window and you should be able to see the button for cookies.

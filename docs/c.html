<span style="color: #cc4b00;font-weight: bold;">File Operations with c</span><br><br>

<p>
C is extermely similar is again similar to JavaScript but it is a compiled language. It suoported in almost every platform since, it is native to most Operating systems.
</p>
<span class="code">
You have to define types with C
<br> You can see the different variable types here https://www.learn-c.org/en/Variables_and_Types
<br>char str[] = "Mike"; ;
<br>printf(b); //printf is used to outout the information on the screen.
</span>
<p class="code">
C is a compiled language so your environment must have the C compiler installed, inorder to test the following code. I am using gcc there are others as well. You can pick any of them. Your installation of the Linux already have them both. Let's try it out.
</p>
<p class="code">

#include<stdio.h> 
    
<br>int main(void) { // void since we are not returning anything 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;//int because C compiler requires a type
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("Hello, world!\n");
   
<br>}
<br>
<br>to test this code we need to compile with gcc
<br>so will compile it like >>gcc -o test test.c
<br>now we have a compile program called test
<br>run it like so >>./test
</p>

<p class="code">
#include<stdio.h> 
    
<br>int main() { // void since we are not returning anything 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;//int because C compiler requires a type
<br>char arr[2][100] =
<br>{ "array of c string",
<br>"is fun to use",
<br>};
<br>printf("%s\n",arr[0] );
<br>}
</p>


<p class="code">
This is what c conditionals look like
</p>
<p class="code">
x = 5
<br>if x > 2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "x is greater than 2"
<br>elsif x <= 2 and x!=0
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "x is 1"
<br>else
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "Don't know"
<br>end
</p>
<p class="code">
Little bit of OOP with c
</p>
<p class="code">

class Dog
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize()
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@age=24 #@this is an instance variable
 <br>end
 <br>def getAge
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return @age
 <br>end
<br>end
<br>myDog = Dog.new
<br>print(myDog.getAge())
</p>
<p>Now let's do some file operations and learn how to write to a file. You can get into the c command line by typing </p><p class="code">>>irb</p><p> and than start writing code. Exit the command line by</p> <p class="code">exit()</p><p>or create a file with the extension "myfile.rb". Get this file executing by typine</p> <p class="code">>>c myfile.rb</p>

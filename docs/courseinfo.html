<br>
<p dir="ltr">You may not download, check-out, clone, copy, or deliver server-side or client-side code directly from 3rd party resources.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You may follow tutorials to understand how to build your own application features and functionalities. Framework's will help you create the server-side feature, however will not build the feature for you. There are resources exist online that have built-in CRUD, API, and Login functionalities. You are asked to build your own and not use these resources as your own and submit them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Please adhere to the Academic Honesty Policy and review Full Sail Guidelines if you have any questions.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Server-Side Languages course examines the benefits of a server-side scripting language to heighten human-computer interaction with web content. In this course, students will learn how to take their existing knowledge of static-based web content and implement a server-side scripting language to develop a more robust web application. By implementing server-side languages within standards-compliant web pages, students will be able to deploy dynamic content to further the level of interaction between client and server communication.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this course you will be continuing to extend your knowledge of object oriented programming using server side languages designed for web development. </p>
<p dir="ltr">All work is due at the time and day specified when the assignment is given. Submission details for work to be graded will be given at the time the work is assigned. If you want me to reconsider your grade on a particular assignment, you must make your request within seven days of my handing out the graded work. Quizzes will be given throughout the semester. If you are absent the day an exam or quiz is given, you will receive a grade of zero. If you know you must miss a class, please speak with me ahead of time so that we can try to make a mutually beneficial arrangement. Some examples of situations that may permit a make-up would be: extreme illness, death in the family, imprisonment, etc. Some examples that will not get you a make-up are: minor illness, sporting events, concerts, routine doctor visits, social events, oversleeping, etc. I do not give separate make-up assignments. If I authorize a make-up for an exam or quiz, the make-up will consist of the final exam or next quiz grade counting twice (once for the make-up grade, and once for the final, or next quiz grade).</p>
<p dir="ltr" class="btitle">Lectures</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lectures are almost entirely made up of coding demonstrations. During these demonstrations, input from the students will direct the work flow to produce a functioning project. Attendance for lecture is based on your instructorâ€™s laptop clock. If you arrive after the clock shows the scheduled start time then you will be counted as late.</p>
<p dir="ltr" class="btitle">Additional Out of Class Material</p>

<p dir="ltr">Each day on FSO contains Integrated learning materials. These include videos, online books, and documentation that contain information that will prepare you for the upcoming lecture. It is imperative that you go through this material to prepare yourself for the coding demonstrations that will be done during lecture. To receive credit for the 2 hours of attendance you will submit a document that has notes you have taken from the materials.</p>
<p dir="ltr" class="btitle">Labs</p>
<p dir="ltr">For most of the labs you will start by creating a new project and you will often find that code you have previously written can be used to expedite some of the initial steps for the lab. There are a few labs that will provide you with a starter project that already has some functionality that you will be adding to or modifying. Lab work should be your own work, helping each other with concepts is fine, but your code should be your own. The labs will be due by midnight on the day following the lab.</p>

<h1 dir="ltr" class="btitle">TURN IN &amp; LATE POLICY</h1>

<p dir="ltr">Late work will be accepted for weighted assignments up to 1 day (23hr 59m 59s) late. Late work past the 1 day mark will not be accepted. All late work will be subject to a -25% penalty to the assignment grade and a deduction to professionalism as follows:</p>

<p dir="ltr">Please make sure that the project you submit is the final one that you want graded. No extra time will be given for assignments that have already been turned in. All assignments must be submitted through FSO and will not be accepted through email or any other method.</p>

<h1 dir="ltr" class="btitle">PLAGIARISM</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Be aware that plagiarism is taken extremely seriously at Full Sail, and that the repercussions are strictly enforced. Cheating is never a good idea. It's not worth it, and you will get caught. Not only are there preventative measures in place, but your instructors have been writing code for decades in some cases. Code plagiarism is easy to spot by a trained eye. Unintended plagiarism is taken seriously as well. Giving another student a direct answer, or a glance at your code, or sharing files will earn both parties a penalty. Protect yourself and the integrity of the degree you're paying and working so hard for by not sharing answers or code. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Often the repercussions are much more harsh, including but not limited to auditing all of your class work since starting Full Sail for other instances of plagiarism. If found, you could be required to retake (and pay for) any class where plagiarism was discovered or expelled from school entirely. Again, It's not worth it.</p>

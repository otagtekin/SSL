<span style="color: #cc4b00;font-weight: bold;">File Operations with Python</span><br><br>

<p>
Python is object oriented and you don't need to declare variables or define types before using them.
</p>
<span class="code">
	var a = "Joe";
	<br>var b = 1;
	<br>print(a); //print is used to outout the information on the screen.
</span>
<p class="code">
python is written very similar to JavaScript, try converting a simple function.
</p>
<p class="code">
function myFunction(){
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("test");
<br>}
</p>
<p class="code">
def myFunction():
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Test")
</p>
<p class="code">
Python lists are also written just like JavaScript
</p>
<p class="code">
myList = [1,"Apples"]
<br>
print(myList[0])
</p>
<p class="code">
#prints out 1,"Apples"
<br>for x in mylist:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print(x)
</p>
<p class="code">
This is what Python conditionals look like
</p>
<p class="code">
name = "John"
<br>if name in ["John", "Rick"]:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Your name is either John or Rick.")
</p>
<p class="code">
Little bit of OOP with Python
</p>
<p class="code">
class Dog:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;def __init__(self): #this is a constructor
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age=24

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;def getAge(self): #this is a method
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return self.age
<br>myDog = Dog()
<br>print(myDog.getAge())
</p>
<p>Now let's builder grader class, do some file operations, and learn how to write to a file. </p>
<p>You can get into the python command line by typing </p>

<p class="code">>>python</p><p> and than start writing code. Exit the command line by</p> <p class="code">exit()</p><p>or create a file with the extension "myfile.py". Get this file executing by typine</p> <p class="code">>>python myfile.py</p>

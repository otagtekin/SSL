<p>
<b><span class="btitle">Overview</span></b>
<br>Practice several languages to interact with the system
<br><br>
</p>

<b><span class="btitle">Description</span></b>
<p>Using the information you have learned anser the questions below.</p>
<b><span class="btitle">Instructions</span></b>
<p><ul>
<li>Use Python, Ruby, and Node lanuges to produce the following functionalities</li>
<li>Create a grader</li>
<li>Create a class "Grader"</li>
<li>Create methods to output a valid grade</li>
<li>Using the command line ask user a question for students name</li>
<li>Using the command line ask user a question for assignment name</li>
<li>Using the command line ask user a question for grade in numbers</li>
<li>Return the letter grade for the assingment

        <br>Assign letter grades based on points earned. Using if/else/elseif statements, create a function that returns a letter grade based on the following point breakdowns when called:
        <br>100-90=A, 80-89=B, 79-70=C, 69-60=D, <60=F
        <br>To test your function, try it with these 5 point values and echo the result back out from the value returned from the function:
        <br>1. 94 
        <br>2. 54 
        <br>3. 89.9 
        <br>4. 60.01 
        <br>5. 102.1        
        <br>Hint: Think about the order in which if/elseif/else evaluates your conditions. Do you test for an "A" condition first and work your way down, or test for "F" and work your way up?

Show errors in command line if there are any.

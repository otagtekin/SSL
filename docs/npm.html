	<b>NPM</b><br>
	When we install node in our system, it comes with a built-in tool called, node package manager (NPM). This tool is design to install libraries and modules required for our code to run.
	<br>
	Here it is a sample npm command. 
</p>
<span class="code">
	>> npm install express;
</span>
<p>
	<b>Express</b><br>
	Express is web application framework design for node. You can take a look at the documentation here. <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>

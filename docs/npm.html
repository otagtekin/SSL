<p>
	<b>NPM</b><br>
	When we install node in our system, it comes with a built-in tool called, node package manager (NPM). This tool is design to install libraries and modules required for our code to run.
	<br>
	Here it is a sample npm command. 
</p>
<span class="code">
	>> npm install express;
</span>
<p>
	<b>Express</b><br>
	Express is web application framework design for node. You can take a look at the documentation here. <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>
	<br> This is where you start building MEAN (Mongo,Express, Angular,Node) stack apps. You don't have to use Angular since there are a lots of alternatives available today.
</p>

<p>Once you install Express using the framework is pretty easy</p>



<span class="code">
var express=require('express'); // tell our application we will use express framework so bring the source
<Br>
var app=express();  // tell our application that use the framework's features by referring to "app"
<Br>
app.get('/',function(req,res) // tell framework that when someone types the root domain name or localhost use this action
<Br>{
	<Br>&nbsp;&nbsp;res.send('Hello SSL Students!'); // show users a message when the get("/") is called
<Br>});
<Br>var server=app.listen(3000,function() {}); // start the server by using the previous instructions.

</span>
<p>
	<b>Nodemon</b><br>
	Nodemon is service that monitors your node application and detects changes to your code. If there is change in the code it automaticsally restarts the server saving you from manually 
	doing the work.
</p>
<p>https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon</p>
<span class="code">
	>> npm install nodemon;
	<br> global install
	npm install -g nodemon
	<br>
	to start server
	<br>
	nodemon app.js 
	<br>
	or<br>
	nodemon server.js

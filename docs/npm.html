<span style="color: #cc4b00;font-weight: bold;">NPM, Express, Nodemon</span><br><br>

<p>
	<b>NPM</b><br>
	<b>Note:</b> Remember to test your npm and node before installing packages.<br>
	When we install node in our system, it comes with a built-in tool called, node package manager (NPM). This tool is design to install libraries and modules required for our code to run.
	<br>
	Here it is a sample npm command. 
</p>
<span class="code">
	>> sudo npm install -g express;
</span>
<p>
	<b>Express</b><br>
	Express is web application framework design for node. You can take a look at the documentation here. <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>
	<br> This is where you start building MEAN (Mongo,Express, Angular,Node) stack apps. You don't have to use Angular since there are a lots of alternatives available today.
</p>

<p>Once you install Express using the framework is pretty easy</p>



<span class="code">
var express=require('express'); // tell our application we will use express framework so bring the source
<Br>
var app=express();  // tell our application that use the framework's features by referring to "app"
<Br>
app.get('/',function(req,res) // tell framework that when someone types the root domain name or localhost use this action
<Br>{
	<Br>&nbsp;&nbsp;res.send('Hello SSL Students!'); // show users a message when the get("/") is called
<Br>});
<Br>var server=app.listen(3000,function() {}); // start the server by using the previous instructions.

</span>


<p>
	<b>Requests</b><br>
Requests are calls made to target destination like Twitter,Google API, or your own server-side. There are several request packages for Node. However, we will use "request" for this lecture. Go ahead and install it then continue with the lecture video.
</p>
<span class="code">
	>> sudo npm install request;
</span>


<p>
	<b>Nodemon</b><br>
	Nodemon is service that monitors your node application and detects changes to your code. If there is change in the code it automatically restarts the server saving you from manually 
	doing the work.
</p>
<p>https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon</p>
<span class="code">
	>> npm install nodemon;
	<br> global install
	npm install -g nodemon
	<br>
	to start server
	<br>
	Via the CLI, use either --legacy-watch or -L for short:
	<br>nodemon app.js -L 
	<br>
	or<br>
	nodemon server.js -L
</span>
<p>
	Now you dont have to keep restarting the app manually. Nodemon keep tracks of the code changes!<br>
<b>Display html page</b><br>
Now let's create and html login form and display it in our application.

<br> Add this to top of your app.js
<span class="code">"use strict";</span>

<p>
Ruby is extermely similar in syntax compare to JavaScript. Don't forget tough Ruby is a server-sdie language, meaning that it doesn't run on the browser like JavaScript. It runs on the server. You do not have specifiy a variable type.
</p>
<span class="code">
a = "Joe";
<br>b = 1.5;
<br>puts a; //print or puts is used to outout the information on the screen.
</span>
<p class="code">
Try converting a simple function.
</p>
<p class="code">
function myFunction(){
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("test");
<br>}
</p>
<p class="code">
def myFunction()
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Test")
<br>end #ending tags are required in Ruby.
</p>
<p class="code">
Python lists are also written just like JavaScript
</p>
<p class="code">
myList = [1,"Apples"]
<br>
puts myList[0]
</p>
<p class="code">
#prints out 1
<br>for i in myList do
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;pus i
<br>end
</p>
<p class="code">
This is what Ruby conditionals look like
</p>
<p class="code">
x = 5
<br>if x > 2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "x is greater than 2"
<br>elsif x <= 2 and x!=0
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "x is 1"
<br>else
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "Don't know"
<br>end
</p>
<p class="code">
Little bit of OOP with Ruby
</p>
<p class="code">
class Dog
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize(): #this is a constructor
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@age=24 #@this is an instance variable

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;def getAge(): #this is an instance method
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return @age
<br>myDog = Dog()
<br>print(myDog.getAge())
</p>
<p>Now let's do some file operations and learn how to write to a file. You can get into the python command line by typing </p><p class="code">>>python</p><p> and than start writing code. Exit the command line by</p> <p class="code">exit()</p><p>or create a file with the extension "myfile.py". Get this file executing by typine</p> <p class="code">>>python myfile.py</p>

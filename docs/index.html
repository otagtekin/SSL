<p>This is the first class that explores the use of server-side scripting to interact with users. Up to this point, you have learned about design elements such as user interface and experience, HTML and how to visually style pages, and client-side scripting such as JavaScript and libraries that execute on the browser. You've learned how data is stored in SQL databases, how to retrieve, update, and delete that data.</p>

<p>For SSL, we take those building blocks you've learned already, and for start to integrate them together to build the full user experience that you see everyday on the Internet. You could think of the server-side as the glue that connects each of these important elements together. We take the HTML that you have designed as static sites and make it interactive. You may have made API calls using jQuery or other libraries to make the client-side interactive; in this class now we can build our own APIs on the server-side to interact with the client side.</p>

<p>If you've never done anything on the server before, or have limited experience, do not worry. Many of the language basics you learned in JavaScript, such as variables, conditionals, loops, and functions still hold true in server languages. In fact the syntax for some server languages such as NodeJs,Python, PHP, or Ruby are very similar to JavaScript, and in fact there are even ways to execute JavaScript on the server-side using technologies such as Node.js.</p>

<p><strong>Class Activities and Assignments</strong></p>
<p>This class is designed so that you can complete portions of material in either many small chunks, or in a few longer sessions. Regardless of how much time you can dedicate to each session, it would be advised to follow the activities in the order they are presented and not skip over activities. Lastly, it would be recommended to keep pace throughout each week, and continually learn new material and reinforcement exercises and sometimes concepts take a few days to sink in for students.</p>
<p>Each learning concept has a series of videos and/or support material where the concepts are introduced, and then an exercise activity that lets you apply that material on your own computer and practice the concept. Each of these concepts will be integrated together in the assignment submitted at the end of the week, so you have a chance to practice and then put together into a fully-working exercise.</p>

<p>If you don't quite understand one of the concepts, reach out for help from your instructor, support staff, and peer students may be able to explain it in another way that helps you make the connection. Also, if a concept makes perfect sense to you from the start, be willing to help out your fellow students too not only does it deepen your own understanding, but sometimes just hearing it from another peer's perspective makes better sense. (Of course, don't ever copy or use someone else's code as your own. There are serious consequences to copying work, all the way to being dismissed from the school.)</p>

<p><strong>Course Overview</strong></p>

<p>This course will be using the several scripting languages, including Nodejs and Python, which are very popular web languages you will encounter in industry. There are many other languages such as Php, Ruby, .Net varieties, and ColdFusion that share a lot of similarities with Node. Once you have mastered the concepts of server-side languages, you could easily learn additional languages.</p>

<p>In Week 1, we will explore the basics of server-side environments such as HTTP requests and responses, then move on to language essentials like variables, control structures, loops, and built-in and user-defined functions. It may seem like a lot of material at first for Week 1, but many of the concepts you have already covered in previous classes, so if you have a good mastery of programming basics this where we will apply those skills to server-side.</p>

<p>In week 2 and 3 we look at sessions and user persistence, then introduce CRUD concepts (database interactions), and using object-oriented concepts in PHP. We will also explore APIs, REST, and extending package managers and additional libraries.</p>

<p>Finally, in Week 4 current technologies such as micro frameworks, REST routing, database object mapping, and page templating are explored. This is designed to transition you to the next class, Advanced Server Side Languages, where you will increase depth in web frameworks and build fully-functioning web applications.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Again, welcome to SSL, we're glad to have you here. How exciting is it to be able to build an interactive web application, in just a few weeks you'll be one step closer. We believe you will find the material valuable in your career as a web designer and developer, and even if you don't end up working primarily on the server-side you will be able to work with and appreciate those that do!</p></div></p>
